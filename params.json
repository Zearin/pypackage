Well now you can!\r\n\r\n\r\n## Features\r\n\r\n * automatic python modules and packages detection\r\n * automatic inclusion of non-python package data files, and their inclusion in and writing of the MANIFEST.in\r\n * support for three different testing frameworks (pytest, nose, and unittest) for use with `setup.py test`\r\n * automatic script detection (any executable file in ./bin or ./scripts)\r\n * curses front-end to python classifiers selection\r\n\r\n\r\n## Example, \"Hello World\" application:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n$ mkdir hello_world\r\n$ cd hello_world\r\n$ vim hello_world.py   # write your python here... :)\r\n$ py-build -is\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe `py-build -is` command will take you through an interactive py-build\r\nsession and save the setup.py to disk after creating it, but will not run it.\r\n\r\nYou can also use the `py-setup` command at any time to print what Pypackage\r\nwould use as a setup.py in the current directory's context.\r\n\r\nMetadata can be mixed in with site-wide defaults from $HOME/.pypackage if you\r\nwant to fill in some common attributes for all your projects.\r\n\r\nPypackage also provides three different test runners to automatically find and\r\nrun your tests with `python setup.py test`, you can use any of pytest, nose or\r\nunittest.\r\n\r\nTo be clear though: pypackage does not intend on replacing setuptools, pip, or\r\nreally anything at all in the python packaging tool-chain, it only attempts to\r\ncompliment those utilities and make getting started with python packaging a\r\nlittle easier.\r\n\r\nIn my utopian perfect dream world, I'd see projects not having a setup.py under\r\nsource control, instead only a static metadata file, then having the inverse\r\nrelationship being true in the distribution version of the package.\r\n\r\n\r\n# Copyright and License\r\n\r\npypicloud-tools was written by Adam Talsma\r\n\r\nCopyright (c) 2015 CCP hf.\r\n\r\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy\r\nof this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal\r\nin the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights\r\nto use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell\r\ncopies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is\r\nfurnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\r\n\r\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all\r\ncopies or substantial portions of the Software.\r\n\r\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR\r\nIMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,\r\nFITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.
